# Caesar's Cipher

Java SE implementations of Caesar Cipher.

See http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/.

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is
'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with
a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
